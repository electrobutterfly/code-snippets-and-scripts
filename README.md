## Process WPDB Geodatabase Files

**

[Process WPDB Geodatabase Files](./wpdb-geodatabase-processor)

The goal is to process and split the **huge geodatabase files** which can be as big as 10GB each,
or even bigger, into smaller json chunks which can be handled better by smaller servers (<= 8GB)
without crashing them, for easy injection as layers into maps. The project is set to use ES modules.
